### Gameplay Patches
- [Alucard Backdash v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2t1m1ygfxr02j7y/AlucardBackdash-v1.ips/file)  - Chain backdashes together, and you can always cancel attacks with backdash.
- [LCancel v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/fh8u7dt52hjfu9k/LCancel-v1.ips/file) - Pressing your ability button (default: L) will cancel any attack or red soul use, even in midair or while crouched.
- [Hungry Mode Patch v1.1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hhytkt4blvvqn37/AoS_Hungrymode_v1-1.ips/file) - Drains between 1 and 4 hp a second (depending on your current HP). Candles and destructibles have a ~1/16 chance to drop a Meat Strip.  v1.1 decreased Meat strip chance and made hp drain proportional.
- [Classicvania Movement v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/sxe9d31g9ywtk0b/AoS_Classicvania-Movement-v1.ips/file) - NES Style movement with no air control (except when using souls like Flying Armor and Giant Bat). You can change directions with double jump or Hippogryph, and when you walk off ledges, you'll drop almost straight down.
- [Panic Mode v1.1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xhia09hrv0oqmi5/AoS_PanicMode-v1-1.ips/file) - Panic mode! The lower your HP, the faster you move.
- [Hazard Mode v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vcat9c9bmhtdylj/AoS_HazardMode-v1.ips/file) - All candles, flames, and destructibles are replaced with damaging skulls that move in a small rectangular path.
- [Slippery Mode v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/fsbyraajz6umsau/AoS_SlipperyMode-v1.ips/file) - Slide on the ground, as well as introducing some midair momentum.
- [Extra Slippery Mode v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/84c0b3yvafhnosq/AoS_ExtraSlipperyMode-v1.ips/file) - Slide even more on the ground, as well as introducing some midair momentum.
- [Attack Shuffle mode v1.1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vdjyoyq23my0el7/AoS_AttackShuffleMode-v1_1.ips/file) - Weapon and Red soul are randomized after every time your XP changes (e.g. Killing enemies and bosses except for Graham and Julius). You are forced to use the weapon and red soul combo until your next XP Change. Red souls only cost 5 MP. (fixed Yellow soul bug with v1.1)
- HyperMode patches - These make all enemies update faster, affecting movement and attack speeds. (1.0 is now compatible with other patches)
    - [Hyper Mode v1.0 (137%)](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ap9ge6mzvzbcoci/AoS_Hypermode_137-v1.ips/file) - 137% enemy/boss speed
    - [Hyper Mode v1.0 (150%)](https://www.mediafire.com/file/04ubhg71qmvrbe9/AoS_Hypermode_150-v1.ips/file) - 150% enemy/boss speed
    - [Hyper Mode v1.0 (175%)](https://www.mediafire.com/file/k1hosnq3dxa5g49/AoS_Hypermode_175-v1.ips/file) - 175% enemy/boss speed
    - [Hyper Mode v1.0 (200%)](https://www.mediafire.com/file/3ji0rvzp66ibk4g/AoS_Hypermode_200-v1.ips/file) - 200% enemy/boss speed

### Balance / Fixes / Other Patches
- [Blue Soul Damage Scale Formula Improvement](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ugqpib4zbf1fihk/BlueSoulDmgImprovement-v1.ips/file) - Changes the blue soul damage formula so that weaker souls will scale better with INT. Stronger souls should remain similar.
- [Soul Containers Don't Seek](https://www.mediafire.com/file/8sfn99vbxq2o55g/SoulContainersDontSeek.ips/file) - Changes Soul containers so that the souls they drop stand still rather than seeking towards Soma. This is useful for the randomizer so that souls that are 'flight locked' require you to be able to fly to actually obtain them.
- [Holiday Pickups v1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/x8qo0o165tr8ue3/AoS_HolidayPickups-v1.ips/file) - All equipment pickups in rooms show present graphics (their original graphics are shown in the menus). Soul canisters are replaced by Xmas trees.
- [Holiday HUD v1.1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xk6q3sqi5i39ngb/AoS_HolidayHUD-v1-1.ips/file) - Changes the HUD with lights for the HP and MP bars, and a Snowman.
