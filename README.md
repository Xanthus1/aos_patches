# &#127876; Aria of Sorrow Holiday Patch Releases by Xanthus
These are patches for Aria of Sorrow that change gameplay. I'm releasing a patch a week leading up to the Holiday season!
Available in [Releases](https://github.com/Xanthus1/aos_holiday_patches/releases) or on https://www.romhacking.net after each release.

You can apply patches to your ROM with an IPS patcher, such as Floating IPS or the [Romhacking.net patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/).
