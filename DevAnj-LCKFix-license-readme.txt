Castlevania Aria of Sorrow Stat Fixes and improvements

The Gameboy Advance game Castlevania Aria of Sorrow has a lot of fans. Obviously not as many as the much
better known Castlevania Symphony of the Night, but there's a certain love many people have for the game.

But besides the multiple translation errors (Curly from Kali and Lubicant instead of Rubicante for 
instance), there's a few flaws in the games' coding. Luck doesn't seem to have much impact on enemy drops 
(items or souls) and Intelligence only impacts blue souls but not red ones. Included are three seperate 
patches.

1. INT: Bullet (red) souls now benefit from higher INT scores. This should also improve Guardian soul
damage as well.

2. LCK: The impact of a higher LUCK stat is now much more obvious. This should help with item drops as
well as soul drops.

3. MP Regen: The regeneration of MP in the vanilla game is kind of slow. Annoyingly slow when you're 
fighting a boss and hoping that you'll get one more shot with the soul you're using. This boosts the
speed of MP regeneration significantly and makes using souls more viable. This stacks with souls and 
equipment that increase MP regen.

These patches are included in the Castlevania Aria of Sorrow Randomizer by Abyssonym and are being posted
by me with permission of original creator Dev Anj. These are the patches I referenced in my review of the 
Aria of Sorrow Rebalanced hack. They do not seem to have had any impact on that patch. You may freely 
reuse and republish them so long as you give credit to Dev Anj and keep this file around. 

I've had several people message me asking me for the patches but I finally am posting them now that I
have his permission to do so.
