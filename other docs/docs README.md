Aria docs README

I wanted to include my current rough notes in this repository for anyone interested
in romhacking / decomp. At some point, it would be great to compile everything
from multiple sources into a single more organized list.

* AoS Doc Notes.txt includes asm labels that I used for Reprise
(with addresses from the base game / rando / Advanced Collection)

* The AoS Ghidra Export XML File is an export from Ghidra (without the game's code)
with some of my documentation / comments.
It's a bit rough, but the documented addresses / functions with comments
may be helpful. Some things are marked with question marks as I was reverse engineering
and investigating, it would be great to get these cleaned up at some point.

* DSVEdit is also a great source of documentation:
